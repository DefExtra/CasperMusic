[X] FAQ

1. access code?

- It can be annoying but this is to ensure constant communication between the user and the developer (it's free by the way) You can get this code from the following website: https://api.casper-dom.gq/

2. spotify clientID/clientSecret

- those keys you can get from the following website: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications login and create an app so you can get those keys

3. lavaLink

- so those configs you can get from 'application.yml' file that you will find in 'servers/downloads/application.yml' from there you can get the port and the password if you host this project in your pc so the host have to be 'localhost' and the secure have to be 'false' but if are hosting this project on replit or and hosting website else that using ssl licenses
